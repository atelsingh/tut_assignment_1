# Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains two Python scripts:

## Task 1
This Python program takes two numerical inputs from the user and performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It then displays the result of each operation, helping users understand how Python handles simple math functions interactively.
